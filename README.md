### OdysseyHQ v.1 :: codenamed **Omer**

Odyssey of the Mind International Headquarters &infin; Teaching &infin; Crativity &infin; Learning &infin;

Since 1978, Odyssey of the Mind has fostered creative thinking and made learning fun through a unique educational program. Millions of students from around the world compete in local, regional, state and national creativity tournaments; less than 1,000 of the most creative minds compete at Odyssey of the Mind's annual World Finals - the pinnacle international team-based divergent problem-solving competition and creativity festival. The Omer project will become OdysseyHQ - an educational social network and learning portal for the global network of independent Odyssey of the Mind Associations.



Today, the Omer project is integrating several open source projects to develop a platform that empowers end-users from around the world to promote cross-cultural interactions and friendships; facilitate communication, collaboration, teaching and learning; and nurture the development of creative problem-sovling skills at every level across the curriculum. Odyssey of the Mind teaches creativity to inspire innovation, and make the world a better place to live. OdysseyHQ seeks to become the most innovative platform to attain those goals.
